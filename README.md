#CROPS ANALYSIS DASHBOARD ON POWER BI#
##POWER BI ON AGRICULTURE##
In today’s world, most economic activities are data-driven, including
Agriculture. Agriculture is no longer just about intuition and experience. Farmers and agribusinesses are increasingly relying on data analytics to optimize crop yields, reduce costs, and improve sustainability. Microsoft Power BI—a business intelligence platform that turns raw data into interactive, insightful dashboards.

When applied to the crops sector, Power BI enables stakeholders to monitor everything from production costs to profits, weather impacts, and market demand. Stakeholders are also able to make meaningful and informed decisions from the insights of the data. Below, we explore how Power BI can be used in agriculture, focusing on crops, and cover all aspects of the process.

#DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION.
Data Cleaning in Power BI is a critical and a must step in ensuring reliable crop analysis because data often comes in bias or inconsistent formats. Using Power Query remove duplicates, fill or replace missing values, and standardize measurements.
In this case, are the steps I took to clean the crops dataset

Changing the formats for the different columns to their required format ,that is ensuring the right data type.

#KEY METRICS
The KPIs show important information from the data.
The Key Performance Indicators I conducted on the dataset include:

Yield in kilograms

Revenue and Profit by Crop Type

Cost of Production

Tracking these indicators helps both smallholder farmers and large agribusinesses make data-backed decisions.

#VISUALIZATIONS
Data visualizations enables one to tell a story about the data.

 

#DATA INSIGHTS FROM THE DATA
##Key Perfomance
• Total Revenue: KES 1.19biliion
• Total Profit: KES 1.10bn
• Average Revenue: KES 121.67million
• Average Profit: KES 197.13k
##Crop Perfomance

Top Performing Crop is rice. It generated KES 133.01M in revenue with KES 114.94M profit.
Rice did produce more revenue during the rainy season and poorly during the dry season.
Sorghum made KES 121.12M revenue with KES 119.18M profit .
Tomatoes was the least revenue generating crop .Its total revenue was 58.11M and profit of 51.99M.
##County Perfomance

Nyeri County was the most productive county 162.05M as total revenue and 160.09M as profit even with it not producing the highest yield.
Nakuru County was the second best performing with a total revenue of132.89M and a total profit of 98.43M.
Nairobi produced the highest yield of crops at 142k KG and Kericho the least of 92k KG of total crops yield
More Insights
• Farmers who used the DAP fertilizer and harvested the most yields while those who used CAN got least yields
• Crops seem to perform better on clay soil and produce more yields than the rest but loam soil produces the least yields.
• The organic crop did best while hybrid did poorly .
• The average crop profit was 197.53M

#CONCLUSION
Power BI has the potential to revolutionize crop management by turning raw agricultural data into actionable insights. From individual farmers to national policymakers, the tool empowers all players in the agricultural ecosystem to make data-driven, sustainable, and profitable decisions.
